			<p></p>I think the purpose of this video is to show people that no matter how different someone is or whether you disagree with their lifestyle choices, that you should never bully someone into hating themselves or make them feel as if their life isn't worth living. I think Randy is also trying to provide an outlet for people who are in a similar situatuion to let them know that no matter how bad it gets, that giving up hope is never the answer and by committing suicide it doesn't solve any problems it just leaves other people to deal with all the problems alone. Most importantly, that life is going to get better. The video achieves its purpose in multiple different ways. It starts by relaying the tragic story of Randy's uncle Ronnie and how he felt so alone that he found no other solution that from the torment of his family and community than to kill himself. It reminds people know of the very real consequences their actions can have. After his Uncle Ronnie's story, Randy tells his own story and how his Uncle's decisions left him with all of the same problems, but he now had to face them alone. And finally, Randy lets everyone know that it's normal to be angry, upset, and alone, but that it is going to get better and one day it is possible to be happy and find others to love. The structure of the message starts with a hand written letter telling the story of Uncle Ronnie and how his community affected his ability to live his life. Then Randy tells his own story to relate back to his purpose of how suicide is never the answer. He finished by using words to explain that all types of love are beautiful and other people shouldn't dictate personal happiness. This structure can help me with my Lived Experiences project because it shows how to tie personal experiences to the purpose of the piece.<p></p> Entry 2<p></p>
		<p></p>	One of the different types of groups targeted by the video are the online gamers who spend too much of their time in the virtual world and don't focus on the real world. Another type are the people who created the games and how they do not necessarily have the same interests and agendas as the people who play the games. The last mentioned are the people who do not care for or understand the gaming world. The social issues covered by this video are how many people spend so much time online in a game that they don't care about things in their real life anymore and how all of the people who made the game don't acually care about that game, they just want people's money so they can live a real life. It also satirizes how important the people think their lives when each person in the game reacts to their death as if a real person died. When the kids finally beat the other gamer who is killing everyone's character, it shows how much of their life they wasted and even though they feel accomplished, they actually just wasted a bunch of their time and have nothing to show for all  their hard work in real life. I think the creators of the video did an excellent job portraying their view on the issue by presenting it in the form of a satire. It presents the topic in a way so that they aren't declaring in a statement that living life vicariously through game and missing out on real life, but gradually explains it throughout the episode and gives real life examples of things they do in a funny way. <p></p>
